# GPX Parser

This is a little project to experiment with parsing GPX files (an XML format used by Garmin for recording activities). There are already programs, such as GoldenCheetah, that have very advanced and useful versions of any information this will contain. In fact, I use GoldenCheetah myself. This is just for fun, and because I haven't used python in a while.

### Stuff you need
